# Learn Software Frameworks For System Design

As large language models mature, traditional coding challenges (like those on LeetCode) are becoming less critical for evaluating software engineers. Consequently, companies are shifting their focus—and rightly so—toward system design. 

This repository is designed to help engineering candidates deepen their understanding of various software frameworks by coding challenges. On the other hand, this repository also enables companies to more effectively assess potential hires.

Key features include:
- **Local Environment Setup**: Run common databases or software frameworks directly on your computer, which saves your trouble for cloud setup;
- **Minimal Code Challenges**: Tackle real system design problems with code challenges intentionally kept under 200 lines of code.

Each directory has a README to instruct for the setup and the code challenges.


## Organize Learnings by Levels
- **level A**: you will need all the time;
  - [A_http_server](./A_http_server/README.md)
  - [A_mysql](./A_mysql/README.md)
  - [A_redis](./A_redis/README.md)
- **level B**: you will need in most system designs;
  - [B_dynamodb](./B_dynamodb/README.md)
  - [B_zookeeper](./B_zookeeper/README.md)
- **level C**: you will need in some challenging system designs;
  - [C_elasticsearch]](./C_elasticsearch/README.md)
  - [C_kafka](./C_kafka/README.md)
- **level D**: you only need if you are specialized in related domains
  - [D_rabbitmq](./D_rabbitmq/README.md)


## Your Contribution is welcome!
I spent some time to build this; but this is far from complete. Therefore, your contribution is welcome!
